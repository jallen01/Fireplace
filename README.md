Fireplace is a to-do list app that automatically shows only relevant tasks at any given time, so that users see fewer and more pertinent tasks. Fireplace allows users to add metadata (like times, days, and locations) to each task they create, and Fireplace uses this metadata to show each task only when the user might want to see it. Fireplace also allows users to create tags which they can attach to tasks for quick and easy metadata input, streamlining the process of creating tasks that fit into common categories. Additional task viewing options Fireplace can take into account include importance, due date, and looking ahead to the next day or week.
