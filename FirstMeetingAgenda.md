Introduce Ourselves :))
-----------------------

+ name, year
+ past experience and comfort level with:
	+ team projects
	+ HTML, CSS, Javascript
	+ Ruby/Rails
	+ git
	+ coding/web development in general
+ it is 100% ok if any one is initially inexperienced/uncomfortable with any of these, as long as we are aware
+ schedule, where you live
	+ where and when do you like to meet for meetings and hack sessions


Team Contract-ish Stuff
-----------------------

+ personal time commitment expectation
+ desired grade and quality of project
+ COMMUNICATION
+ making plans and following through
+ allowing other team members to help you
	+ if you run into difficulty, whether it be you are too busy some week or you are having trouble getting certain code to work, SPEAK UP, don't keep it to yourself, since we are a team and more information/communication is always better, and we are here to help each other
	+ this goes hand in hand with the following through point, since not being able to follow through is NOT THAT BIG AN ISSUE IF YOU WARN PEOPLE AHEAD OF TIME


Possible Technologies To Use
----------------------------

(these are all up for debate, and in general require simple e-mail confirmation sign-up)
+ Trello for TODO's
+ Gliffy for diagrams
+ Hastebin for code collaboration
+ Google Docs for documentation
+ Google Hangout for remote meetings and such


Coding and Collaborating Habits and Practices
---------------------------------------------

+ all agree on basic git habits like when to push/pull, what branches should exist at any given time, etc.
+ write NEAT, READABLE code
+ COMMENT code
+ before doing anything risky or complicated (like modifying important working files), consult with other team members
+ attempt to follow rails convention whenever possible
+ be consistent with your coding style (goes along with the neat and readable code point)
+ think about, discuss, and solidify design before writing code


A lot of this seems like insignifcant detail and possibly a little silly, but it is crazy how little work it is to follow these kinds of things compared to how amazingly better the develoment experience and result ends up because of them.
