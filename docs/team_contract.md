Team Contract
=============

Expected level of achievement and effort for each team member
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Tyler Singer-Clark: 
> “This is my ‘main class’ this semester and feel comfortable committing substantial time and effort to this project. I am striving for an A, and have enough time to invest in this, so I feel confident investing my pride in it, meaning I want the quality of the project to be extremely high, as it will reflect my actual ability.”

- Michelle Johnson: 
> “I want an A so I am willing to devote a lot of time and effort to this project. I also want to end up with a product that I can show off. I promise to let everyone on the team know ahead of time if I cannot make a meeting.” 

- Rebecca Krosnick: 
> “I want to do well in this class and be proud of our final product so will put a significant amount of effort into this project.”

- Jonathan Allen: 
> “I would like to help develop a project that is useful and well implemented that will be a useful tool, not just a project that satisfies the class requirements.”

- TeamSpider: 
> “We have seen each other’s statements, and are all on board with one another’s.”

Personal goals for each team member
-----------------------------------

- Rebecca Krosnick: 
> “I want to get more experience with Ruby on Rails and with medium-scale development so that I can be better prepared for working as a developer at tech companies. I’d also like to get more experience with AJAX.”

- Michelle Johnson: 
> “I would like to get more experience with routing and data modeling. Pretty much I’m trying to get more backend experience. I would also like to be a part of the UI designing process. I also would like to work on my optimization skills and get better at git. ”

- Tyler Singer-Clark: 
> “I have not made a project since being at my current level of ability, so I would like to create something better (more substantial and more professional) than I have before. I would like to hone my teamwork/organization/collaboration skills.”

- Jonathan Allen: 
> “In previous projects I spent far more time than necessary familiarizing myself with Rails and the other software tools used in this class. For this project, I would like to spend less time learning these tools and put more emphasis on the project design.”

Frequency, length, and location of team meetings
------------------------------------------------

**TeamSpider:**
> “We promise to meet in person at least 2 times every week. We may need more, but 2 times is a minimum. We also may need to hangout remotely via Google Hangout in addition to the in person meetings. In person meetings will be a minimum of 1 hour long, but likely will be longer for design discussions and hacking. Meetings will be in the Student Center, unless specified otherwise.”

How quality of work will be maintained
--------------------------------------

**TeamSpider:**
> “We will be doing an informal code review of each other’s work during the week. This means if we come across any stylistic issues or bad coding practices as we code our website, we will contact the primary author and suggest changes that he or she should make. A formal code review will be done at each deadline before we submit. In terms of style, our default tab size is 4 in the Sublime text editor (tab size of 2 for HTML). This is to keep our code tidy and consistent. Additionally, if any team member feels they are having issues for whatever reason (especially busy one week, can’t figure out a certain bug) meeting a deadline or maintaining a high quality of work, they will let the others know so they can happily pick up the slack temporarily, allowing the average quality of work to remain high.”
	
How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed
------------------------------------------------------------------

**TeamSpider:** 
> “Before assigning any tasks, we will discuss all the tasks. Only at that point will we divvy up the work between the members. We will assign the tasks on a volunteer basis, with some weight given to who feels most suited to each particular task. If no one wants the task, we will try to assign multiple people to it so that no 1 person feels too much of a burden. And if multiple people want the same task, we will act on a case-by-case basis, deciding as a group what is best for the project. If a deadline is missed, we will, as a team, figure out why it happened and then act accordingly so that it does not happen again (this is vague but that is because there are many reasons to miss a deadline and some should be dealt with differently than others).”

How decisions will be made and disagreements resolved
-----------------------------------------------------

**TeamSpider:** 
> “As reasonable people, we will discuss the pros and cons of each option and then vote as a team. In the case of a tie (since we have 4 people), we will continue to discuss the issue until someone is convinced. As computer scientists, you probably see this as an issue since an infinite loop is possible, but we are relying on our ability to be rational and kind to avoid this.”
