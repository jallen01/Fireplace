Team Reflection
============

##Peer Reviews

###Michelle Johnson’s Reviews

+ **Jon**
> Put the team on his back and set up most of the framework of the app. He played a huge part in setting up the models and did an awesome job. Could communicate more when making changes to the code and leave more comments when implementing features.

+ **Rebecca**
> Did a great job setting up the forms and their validations, especially when it came to the locations feature. Very hardworking and didn’t give up easily. Constantly thought of multiple ways to solve a problem. Sometimes her code was a little “hacky” but nothing really serious. 

+ **Tyler**
> Paid great attention to the design of the website. Came up with a lot of ideas to remedy problems and did a great job running the tests on our website. He could have contributed a little more to the actual implementation of the website but his contributions in testing make up for it.  

###Tyler Singer-Clark’s Reviews

+ **Michelle**
> Could Improve: creativity in fixing bugs, instead of getting stuck find a work around
> Solid: fearless coder, tackles new or difficult tasks without complaint for the sake of a better product

+ **Jon**
> Could improve: being present for all crucial times like deadlines, commenting for non-trivial methods and snippets
> Solid: ability to create robust code, adheres to good software design principles, resourceful

+ **Rebecca**
> Could improve: risk-taking, be willing to reach slightly beyond coding comfort-zone without hesitation
> Solid: persistence, honorable quality of doing everything possible to finish something once it’s started which is possibly the most important trait to look for in a teammate

###Jon Allen’s Reviews

+ **Tyler**
> Solid: Was excellent at organizing the team and setting up meetings. Always had a positive attitude. Double checked everything in the project before each deadline. 
> Could improve: Pausing more often during discussions to wait for quieter team members to offer their ideas.

+ **Rebecca**
> Solid: Very hard working; always put in as much time as necessary to get tasks done. Rarely gave up on problems. Communicated very well with everyone and wasn’t afraid to speak up when she disagreed with a decision made by the rest of the group.
> Could improve: Looking up more things on Google. Not necessary to reinvent the wheel when coding, better to look at APIs and Stack Overflow when you get stuck.

+ **Michelle**
> Solid: Was typically the first person to arrive at meetings. Reliable; seamlessly integrated her features into the system and communicated with the rest of the group how the features worked.
> Could improve: Not being afraid to scrap code and start over when stuck.

###Rebecca Krosnick Reviews

+ **Michelle**
> Michelle always had a positive attitude and was very resourceful, finding information online about geocoders and applying it to the project, and also looking back at code from her previous projects to help me when I had implementation issues. She could become a little more fluent in Ruby on Rails, but I can certainly say the same of myself.

+ **Tyler**
> Tyler was committed and focused on the success of the team. He contributed lots of great ideas for the concept and design of the project. I think in the future he could contribute more to the implementation of the app but he was very helpful in writing the tests and documentation.

+ **Jon**
> Jon was very talented in all the technologies involved in implementation. He set up the models and had a large hand in all aspects of the project, contributing more than his fair share. He was patient and very helpful in helping the rest of us when we ran into implementation issues of our own.


##Overall Evaluation

###Things we did well
+ Coding together in person during the days leading up to each deadline allowed us to iterate quickly, get immediate feedback on UI, and help each other debug
+ Very quick to help each other out if stuck on a problem
+ Finding alternative solutions if the first idea doesn’t work
+ Even when things were less than ideal, no fighting or negative conflict, always worked together toward common goal of creating the most successful app we could

###Things we could do in the future to improve
+ Start working on milestones of the project even earlier to allow more time for implementation/design changes and debugging
+ Explicitly assign tasks to each person to do on their own time and complete before the next meeting
+ Split up tasks better so that group members can work more autonomously between meetings
+ Communicate when large changes to the code are made

##Key Lessons Learned
+ Nailing down the design (every little aspect one can think of) helps SO MUCH when it comes time to implement. It allows developers to focus only on simple well-defined tasks because design choices are already solid.
+ Git saves lives.
+ If using gems or external libraries, have backup plans ready at the beginning. If one option doesn’t work out then try the next gem or figure out another solution.
+ One can never be absolutely sure how near the project is to completion (finding bugs suddenly, deploying to heroku is non-trivial, cross-browser issues can pop-up out of nowhere), and should plan on finishing very early so these unexpected things are manageable.
