Mentor Meeting #4 - Agenda
==========================

- Show current state of project

- Explain tasks that have yet to be done

- Ask for "end of project advice", i.e. anything we should keep in mind as we approach the end of the project, the demo, common mistakes or things groups often are missing

- Ask for project specific comments, i.e. anything jump out as something we should fix, take care of, alter, add

- Thank TA's for their help this semester, it's been a lot of fun and we have learned a lot
