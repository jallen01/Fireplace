Mentor Meeting #3 - Agenda
==========================

Questions
---------

+ How to set the value of a hidden_tag parameter from javascript? We were trying to do this in our tasks.js file to set a hidden_tag parameter in /tasks/_form.html.erb. After setting the value of the appropriate element in javascript I checked the element value in javascript and it had been changed, but when the submit button is pressed and I try to read the value in the tasks controller, the parameter appears to be nil.
Since we’ve made changes to get around this issue (that result in less desirable UI), see the problem here at this commit: https://github.com/6170-fa13/tscizzle_michelleoj_krosnick_jallen01_final/tree/1d09048ec52d268a5dd1382cb46ed2cf5c256f94

+ What do you think of our new design with no nested tags (except for the day_range and location tags)?

+ Way to get rid of login error message and still have tasks/index be home page? Minor, but kinda annoying and unprofessional

Rest of Meeting
---------------

+ Bring up any other issues/design questions/implementation questions

+ Plan next meeting (just TeamSpider, mentor doesn’t need to stay for this)
