Mentor Meeting #4 - Notes
=========================

Present - Jonathan, Tyler, Rebecca, Dalton

Suggestions for final product
---------------------------------
+ Try to get rid of scrolling in modals
+ Have a "task created" flash on the front page so that when a task that isn't relevant at the current time/location is created, the user will be able to get some feedback that the task indeed has been created
+ Suggestion for future projects: have 2 heroku apps - for staging and production
